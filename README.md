The project aims to build a predictive model capable of determining whether a given text conveys positive, negative, or neutral sentiment.

Initially there were 4 datasets given, namely 
“train.csv”, 
“test.csv”, 
“training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv” and 
“testdata.manual.2009.06.14.csv”.

The format of the first two files were similar and the latter two were similar, so I made two different applications, one with the first two datasets and the other with the latter files.

In the second application after I had combined the data, i had made a new csv file containing only 3 columns because the process of editing and combining the data took a lot of time so for easy use, 
I made a csv and uploaded the data.

Due to size iisues, I couldn't upload the new csv file here and the link to all csv files is here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mF6dfNNhoW8DHec2XuHlqRRi_r9E7kat?usp=sharing
